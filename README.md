# Kodiak
A database application for managing Sitka courses.

#### Goals
As outlined in my project proposal, my goal here was to create a database application where you can add and organize activities, lessons, and courses. I have completed all those goals.

## Database Scripts
kodiak_create.sql is my database creation Script.
There is also a inserts.sql but it really only has inserts for the ActivityTypes table. 
The point is to use this application to create the rest of the data.
